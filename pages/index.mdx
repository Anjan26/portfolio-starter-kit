      brief explanation for each.

           5 most favourite tasks:

          a. Dig through logs to troubleshoot a customers broken project: Reviewing the logs in order to troubleshoot a customers malfunctioning project not only provides an opportunity for me to acquire new insights but also serves to minimize the customer&apos;s burden in resolving the issue.
          b. Write and maintain support articles and docs pages: It is always valuable to create knowledge base articles to assist both internal and external stakeholders in streamlining processes and resolving issues effectively.</li>
          c. Manage a support team: I am actively involved in managing a global support team, fostering collaboration among team members, assisting in problem identification, and guiding the team towards solutions. I maintain close monitoring of issues and ensure timely and accurate reporting through appropriate channels.
          d. Work with the product team to develop a new feature based on feedback from customers: I actively collaborate with the product team to devise a new feature in response to customer feedback. It would be beneficial to establish an internal product feedback ticket to ensure the team can cross-validate and coordinate the scheduling of the future release effectively.
          e. Work with engineering teams during incidents and provide updates to internal and external stakeholders: I strongly believe in collaborating with engineering teams during incidents to provide timely updates to both internal and external stakeholders. This ensures that issues are resolved promptly, allowing customers to use our services and products without any hassle.
