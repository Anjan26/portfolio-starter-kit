   <h4>4. When would you choose to use Edge Functions, Serverless Functions, or Edge
      Middleware with Vercel?
   </h4>
   <p>Edge Functions are executed at the edge of Vercel's network, enabling you to run code in proximity to your users. This leads to improved response times.</p>
   <p>Serverless Functions are designed to run in response to HTTP requests, enabling you to create dynamic backend logic without the need to handle server infrastructure.</p>
   <p>The Edge middleware operates before the backend logic, whereas the Edge function is designed to act as the backend logic.</p>
   <p>Edge Functions, Serverless Functions, and Edge Middleware are distinct tools offered by Vercel to serve various purposes that depend on the specific requirements of your application and the level of control and performance optimization you need at the edge.</p>
   <h4>5. Imagine a customer writes in requesting help with a build issue on a framework or
      technology that you've not seen before. How would you begin troubleshooting this and
      what questions would you ask the customer to understand the situation better?
   </h4>
   <p>First, I will gather all the necessary information from the customer to fully understand the source of the issue</p>
   <p>I will ask questions to customer, to explain and provide me the detailed steps of how to reproduce the issue they are experiencing.  </p>
   <p>I will thoroughly investigate the issue by reviewing error logs, previous tickets, our knowledge base articles, and documentation. I will also conduct online searches to identify and address the error.</p>
   <p>This information will allow me to verify the problem before engaging with our internal teams and members for assistance. </p>
   <h4>6. The customer from question 5 replies to your response with the below:
      “I’m so frustrated. I’ve been trying to make this work for hours and I just can’t figure it
      out. It must be a platform issue so just fix it for me instead of asking me questions.”
      Please write a follow-up reply to the customer.
   </h4>
   <p>I completely understand your concern regarding the issue at hand. I am currently collaborating with our team to thoroughly investigate and address the matter promptly.
      If you are available, I would be delighted to arrange a brief call to further discuss the issue you are experiencing. This will allow me to share any additional updates and provide insight into our current progress.
   </p>
   <h4>7. A customer writes in to the Helpdesk asking "How do I do a redirect from the /blog
      path to https://example.com?" Please write a reply to the customer. Feel free to add any
      information about your decision making process after the reply.
   </h4>
   <p>To redirect the /blog path to https://example.com, you can consider implementing a rewrite rule. More information on this can be found in our documentation at: https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/redirecting#redirects-in-nextconfigjs
      Utilizing the redirects option in the next.config.js file enables you to redirect incoming request paths to alternative destination paths.
   </p>

      engines. Please write a reply to the customer. Feel free to add any information about
      your decision making process after the reply.
   </h4>
   <ol>
      <p>There are several strategies you can employ to control how search engines index your site.
      </p>
      <li>Robots.txt File: By creating and uploading a "robots.txt" file to your site's root directory, you can specify which pages or sections should be excluded from search engine indexing.</li>
      <li>Meta Tags: Including specific meta tags in your Next.js site's HTML can help direct search engines to avoid indexing certain pages.</li>
      <li>Password Protection: Implementing password protection for your site or specific pages adds an extra layer of security to ensure only authorized users can access the content.</li>
      <li>Server-side Rendering (SSR) Control: Utilizing Next.js's server-side rendering capabilities allows for conditionally rendering meta tags or implementing server-side logic to control indexing based on your preferences.</li>
      <li>Disallow Directories: By disallowing specific directories in the robots.txt file, you can restrict search engine crawlers from accessing those parts of your site.
      </li>
   </ol>
